# Description

Yet another attempt to build the framework of my dreams.
This time though I will apply this to an actual usecase : A 3D Printer firmware.

The first motherboard target will be the Duet3d : DuetWifi.
As AVR is ported to rust's mainstream, the project is to get other ATMega based device ported too.
